## Installation

Choose the installation method that matches your workflow!

### Installation via Contao Manager

Search for `terminal42/contao-shortlink` in the Contao Manager and add it to your installation. Finally, update the
packages.

### Manual installation

Add a composer dependency for this bundle. Therefore, change in the project root and run the following:

```bash
composer require terminal42/contao-shortlink
```

Depending on your environment, the command can differ, i.e. starting with `php composer.phar â€¦` if you do not have
composer installed globally.


## Bundle configuration

**Default configuration:**
```yaml
terminal42_shortlink:
    host: ~
    prefix: ~
    min_length: 0
    catchall_redirect: ~
    salt: terminal42_shortlink
    log_ip: false
```

- **host:** The host to use for shortlinks. Can be different than the website host,
    but make sure it is set up on your hosting/server.

- **prefix:** Optionally configure a prefix, e.g. `go/` to generate with all shortlinks.

- **min_length:** Minimum lengths of shortlinks. Applies to the generated hash ID as well 
    as to the alias input in the back end. 

    This can be useful if you want to use the same domain for shortlinks and a regular website.
    By setting the shortlink length to something higher than the root page URL prefix, you
    can make sure there's never a conflict between a shortlink and the regular website.

- **catchall_redirect:** If you configure a host exclusively for shortlinks, you can
    redirect all unknown requests to a URL (e.g. your regular website). 

- **salt:** If a shortlink does not have a custom alias (path), a unique hash ID is
    generated from the database ID. By changing the salt you can get unique IDs for your
    installation.

- **log_ip:** This extension records how often a shortlink is accessed. Enable this
    flag to also capture IP addresses (not allowed under DSGVO in europe!)
